# Forms and Validation 
Before the data in forms are submitted to the server, there are checks done to ensure the data matche the correct format(form control). This is called Client-side validation.

A form control is an element that enable user interactions with the form: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, `<select>`.

## Using Forms To Get Data From Your Users
We use the `<form>` element and wrap it around other elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>` to get the data. once the user fills the form and hits the CTA button, the browser makes a request and script can respond to that request and process the data.
By default, this request is made to the page the form is being rendered. Eg. 
```
<form action="https://example.com/accounts>
...
</form>
```
A script on the `example.com` backend can handle requests to the `/accounts` and then the data is processed.
* By default form data is sent as a `GET` request. you can change it by doing `<form method="post"></form>`
  * This is because of historical or technical reasons, not necessarily because it is the optimal choice for all situations.
    **Here's why GET is the default:**
     * Historical context: When HTML and HTTP were first developed, the web was primarily a document retrieval system. GET was the fundamental operation for accessing resources.
     * Simplicity: GET requests are simpler to process and don't require special handling of request bodies.
     * Idempotence: GET requests are meant to be idempotent (can be repeated without side effects), aligning with the original vision of HTML forms as primarily for retrieving or filtering information.
   
     NB: For forms that process sensitive data, use the `POST` method. This will make it only accessible to the backend scripts that processes the request. If the data is sharable, you can use the `GET` method; that way, it can be added to your browser history as it is included in the URL. This is useful in search forms.

    âœ…Using the appropriate form control helps you build better forms
    * `<label>` elements allow us briefly state what we are expecting the user to enter into the form field. eg. input
      ```
      <label for="favBook">What is your favorite Book?<label>
      <inout type="text" id="favBook" name="favBook">
      ```
      Note that the `for` attribute in the works in labels like it the `id` works in input. The `id` connects the input and the label
